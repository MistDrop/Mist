   *
   * @apiParam {String[]} [addresses] A comma-separated list of
   *           addresses to filter transactions to/from.
   *
   * @apiQuery {Boolean} fetchNames When supplied, fetch the
   *           count of owned names for each address.
   *
   * @apiSuccess {Number} found The amount of addresses that were successfully
   *             returned.
   * @apiSuccess {Number} notFound The amount of addresses that were not
   *             returned.
   * @apiSuccess {Object} addresses Object keyed by address containing their
   *             data, or `null` if the address was not found.
